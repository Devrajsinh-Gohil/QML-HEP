## Task 2 (Answers)

- PointNet and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) architectures that work well with point cloud data can be used to classify jets as quarks or gluons. PointNet uses an MLP neural network to extract features directly from raw point cloud data. GCN is based on graphs, which represent point cloud data as a network of nodes and edges. GCN extracts feature using convolutional operations and aggregate them to produce a global feature vector that represents the entire graph.

- When deciding which architecture to use, we must consider the dataset's characteristics as well as the desired performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- Both PointNet and GCN have been shown to achieve high accuracy in point cloud classification tasks in terms of performance. PointNet, on the other hand, is more computationally efficient and can handle larger point clouds than GCN. GCN, on the other hand, can handle more complex graph structures and capture node relationships better than PointNet. 

- To summarise, both PointNet and GCN can be used to classify jets as quarks or gluons. PointNet is more computationally efficient and better suited for dealing with larger point clouds, whereas GCN is better suited for dealing with more complex graph structures and capturing node relationships. The architecture chosen is determined by the task's specific requirements and the characteristics of the dataset.

## Task 3

- Quantum computing and quantum machine learning are exciting and rapidly developing fields that have the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries and scientific disciplines. Quantum computing employs quantum mechanics principles to perform computations that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers. Similarly, quantum machine learning makes use of quantum computing to create algorithms that solve complex problems more efficiently than traditional machine learning algorithms.

- The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), a quantum analog of the classical discrete Fourier transform, is one quantum algorithm with which I am familiar. Many quantum algorithms rely on QFT, including Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers and the quantum phase estimation algorithm. The classical Fourier transform requires an exponential number of operations, whereas QFT can be efficiently implemented on a quantum computer using only a polynomial number of gates.

- In terms of quantum software, I have experience working with the Qiskit In terms of quantum software, my expertise is in using the Cirq library, a popular open-source software toolkit for quantum computing. Cirq provides a user-friendly interface for designing, simulating, and running quantum circuits on Google's quantum processors or a simulator. This library also includes advanced features such as noise modeling and error correction, which are required for developing real-world quantum applications.

- Regarding possible future work, I'm curious about quantum algorithms for optimization and machine-learning problems. Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving eigenvalue problems, is one promising method on which I'd like to work. VQE has applications in chemistry, materials science, and finance, and it has the potential to transform these fields by providing more accurate and efficient simulations of complex systems.
